### **1. What is the Copernican Revolution in Philosophy?**

Kant believed that philosophy needed to do something similar to what **Nicolaus Copernicus** did in astronomy. Copernicus proved that the Earth revolves around the Sun, not celestial bodies around the Earth. Similarly, **Kant reversed the direction of the relationship between the mind and the world.**

-   **Pre-Kantian Thought (Naïve Realism):** The mind is passive and must **conform** to a pre-existing, independent world. Knowledge is a reflection of the world in the mind.
-   **Kant's Revolution (Transcendental Idealism):** The mind is **active**. The world of experience (phenomena) is **constructed and organized** by the mind's innate structures. We only know things as they fit into the molds of **space, time**, and the **categories of the understanding** (like causality). Therefore, we **impose laws upon nature**, rather than merely extracting them from it. This revolution explains the possibility of **certain science** (like Newtonian physics), but it also **limits our knowledge to the world of phenomena** and makes access to the "thing-in-itself" impossible.

### **2. What was Kant's Achievement in Each of His Major Works?**

-   **Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787):** An investigation into **the limits and possibility of theoretical knowledge**. Conclusion: Theoretical reason is **powerless** in the realm of metaphysics (God, the soul, free will, the world as a whole). These concepts are "regulative," not "constitutive" of knowledge.
-   **Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1783):** An attempt to provide a simpler summary and defense of the principles of the *Critique of Pure Reason* against early critics.
-   **Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785):** Presents the **foundation and essence of deontological ethics** and formulates the **Categorical Imperative**, without going into systematic details.
-   **Critique of Practical Reason (1788):** Completes the ethical system. Shows where **practical reason** (morality) can begin where theoretical reason ends. Introduces the ideas of **freedom, immortality, and God** as **necessary postulates of practical reason**.
-   **Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790):** Bridges the two realms of nature (First Critique) and freedom (Second Critique). Examines **aesthetic judgment** (taste) and **teleological judgment** (purposiveness in nature) as mediators that create a feeling of harmony between these two worlds.
-   **Perpetual Peace (1795):** Presents a philosophical and political blueprint for achieving **lasting peace** among states through a federal union based on republicanism and mutual respect.

### **3. Did He Answer His Three Fundamental Questions?**

Kant provided systematic answers, but these answers are not "certain" in a scientific sense; they are **transcendental frameworks**.

1.  **What can I know? Answer:** I can only know the **world of phenomena**. Knowing **noumena** (things-in-themselves) is impossible.
2.  **What ought I to do? Answer:** I must act in accordance with the **Categorical Imperative**, which springs from pure practical reason and relies on the **autonomy** of the will.
3.  **What may I hope for? Answer:** I can **hope** for the **immortality of the soul** and the **existence of God** as practical prerequisites necessary for the realization of the highest good (the union of virtue and happiness), even though I cannot prove them theoretically.

**Result:** He answered in a way that demonstrates the **possibility of science, the foundation of ethics, and the logic of hope**, while prohibiting theoretical reason from making dogmatic claims in metaphysics.

### **4. What is Kantian Ethics?**

It is a **duty-based, rational, and intention-focused** ethics. Key characteristics:

-   **Moral Action = Action from Duty:** Not from inclination, interest, or fear.
-   **Measure = The Categorical Imperative:** A universal, rational, and all-encompassing principle.
-   **Central Focus = Human Dignity:** Humanity (in oneself and others) is an end in itself, never merely a means.
-   **Example:** Telling the truth even if it is to your detriment, because you cannot universalize the maxim "lying is permissible" (society would collapse based on distrust).

### **5. What Have Others Said About Him?**

-   **Arthur Schopenhauer:** Considered Kant the "greatest modern thinker," though he strongly criticized him.
-   **Hegel:** "With Kant, new philosophy begins... he restored universality and necessity to the subject."
-   **Friedrich Nietzsche:** Although a critic of Kant's ethics, he admired his intellectual power and called him the "philosopher of philosophers."
-   **Ludwig Wittgenstein (early work):** Was influenced by the phenomenon/noumenon distinction.
-   **Martin Heidegger:** "Kant is the first and only one to have taken some steps in the direction of posing the question of the essence of man."

### **6. Major Criticisms of Kant's Philosophy**

-   **The "Thing-in-Itself" Problem:** How can we accept the existence of something that is absolutely unknowable? How can this "thing" affect our senses and provide the raw material for experience? (Critics: **Fichte, Hegel**).
-   **Excessive Abstraction in Ethics:** Kant's ethics ignores emotions, specific relationships, and objective circumstances. A duty determined by pure reason may be inhuman or impossible in practice.
-   **A Dualistic World:** Dividing the world into phenomenon and noumenon created an **unbridgeable gap** that later Idealist philosophers tried to fill.
-   **Universalism:** Do truly universal principles, free from culture and history, really exist? (Critics: **Relativists, feminists**).
-   **Neglect of History and Society:** Kant's rational individual is depicted in isolation from their historical and social context.

### **7. Kant's Weakness (From a Modern Perspective)**

A primary weakness is his **insufficient attention to "language."** Kant speaks about the structures of the mind, but how are these structures manifested in language and speech? The **"linguistic turn"** in 20th-century philosophy showed that many philosophical problems (including some of Kant's dualisms) are rooted in **the structure of language**. Furthermore, his **over-reliance on pure reason** and neglect of the role of the body, emotions, and the unconscious in shaping experience and ethics are considered other weaknesses.

### **In-Depth Follow-Up Questions**

**1. How exactly did Kant reverse the direction of the relationship between mind and world?**

Before Kant, two main philosophical currents existed:
*   **Rationalists** (e.g., Descartes, Leibniz): Believed the "mind" with its innate ideas and concepts was the primary source of knowledge, and truth about the world could be reached through logical reasoning.
*   **Empiricists** (e.g., Locke, Hume): Believed the "external world" was the primary source of knowledge. The mind was like a blank slate (**Tabula Rasa**) on which sensory experiences were imprinted, and all concepts were derived from these experiences.

**Kant's Role:** Kant showed that both views were incomplete. He said his predecessors were mistaken on a fundamental principle: they assumed **the mind must conform to the world.** That is, the mind is passive and must discover how the world "really" is.

**Kant's Copernican Revolution stated: No! It is not the world that dictates to the mind; it is the mind that gives **structure and order** to the world.**

**Analogy:** It's like realizing that instead of our glasses having to adjust to the world (which is impossible), we **always look at the world through specific lenses** (the lenses of "space," "time," and "causality"). We can never see the world without these lenses. Therefore, everything we see is pre-formed by them.

**Result:** We never know the "world-in-itself" (the thing-in-itself / **Noumenon**). We only know the "phenomenal world" (**Phenomenon**), which is the product of the cooperation between "sensory data from the world" and the "mind's innate molds." Therefore, **in cognition, the mind is active and constructive, not passive and receptive.**

**2. What is the "Constructor of Knowledge" from Kant's perspective?**

The "constructor of knowledge" is not a single agent but a **two-stage process** between the mind and sensory data.

**1. The Stage of Sensibility:**
*   **Reception:** Through the senses, the mind receives the raw, formless material of experience (sensory data) from the world.
*   **Initial Molding:** This raw material is immediately placed into two **a priori molds** of the mind: **space** (for outer perception) and **time** (for inner perception and the sequence of events). This stage arranges the "parts" of experience into a coherent spatio-temporal framework.

**2. The Stage of Understanding:**
*   **Categories:** Here the primary "constructor" of knowledge comes into play: the **twelve categories of the understanding**. These are pure, innate concepts of the mind, such as **cause and effect, substance and accident, possibility and impossibility**.
*   **Construction:** The understanding **organizes** the phenomena molded in space and time using these categories and gives them **meaning and relation**. For example, using the category of "causality," it connects two sequential events as "cause and effect."
*   **Result:** The outcome of this process is **organized and comprehensible knowledge of the phenomenal world**; that is, the world of science and everyday life.

**Final Result:** **The ultimate constructor of knowledge is the combined activity of the "Understanding," which uses its a priori categories to transform spatially and temporally structured sensory data into an "objective experience."** Without this constructive activity of the mind, we would only face a chaotic jumble of sensations, not a coherent world.

**3. The Categorical Imperative, Reason, and Mind from Kant's View**

These three concepts show different levels of the mind's activity.

**A) Mind** – (In the general sense):
The entire human cognitive apparatus, including all three faculties below.

**B) Reason** – (The highest faculty):
*   **Function:** Reason is the mind's highest faculty. It has an innate desire for **totality and the absolute**. It operates in both the theoretical and practical realms.
*   **Theoretical Reason:** Seeks to go beyond the cognition of particular, conditioned things (which the understanding does) to reach **regulative ideas** (God, the soul as a whole, the world as a whole). But it cannot acquire **knowledge** about them.
*   **Practical Reason:** This is where reason reaches its peak. When it comes to **action**, reason can **create** the moral law. Practical reason is the legislator of morality.

**C) The Categorical Imperative** – (The command of practical reason):
*   **What is it?** The formulation of the **fundamental law of morality** that arises from "pure practical reason."
*   **Its Logic:** It is a **clear formula** that tells us how to determine if a rule of action (our personal "maxim") is moral or not: "Can you will that this rule should become a **universal law** for all human beings?"
*   **Relationship to Reason:** The Categorical Imperative is the **voice of practical reason**. It shows that when reason enters the realm of action, it is no longer just "regulative" but the **creator of the moral law**. Obeying the Categorical Imperative means obeying a law that our own reason has established (autonomy), not an external source.

**Summary of the Relationship:**
The **Mind** (generally) includes the faculty of **Reason**. Reason in the domain of action (**Practical Reason**) creates the moral law, formulated as the **Categorical Imperative**. Therefore, following the Categorical Imperative is the peak of maturity and freedom of the rational mind.

**4. Kant from the Perspective of Nietzsche and Freud**

Both considered Kant a very important philosopher but viewed him from a completely different and critical standpoint.

**A) Nietzsche's Critique: An Attack on the Foundations of Kant's Ethics**
1.  **Critique of Motive:** Nietzsche was the greatest opponent of ethics based on "self-denial" and the "denial of life." In his view, Kant's ethics dressed **Christian values** (like self-denial, duty) in the philosophical garb of the "rational" and "universal." He asks: Where does this "duty" come from? Does it not stem from the **resentment of the weak** towards the strong and earthly life?
2.  **Critique of Pure Reason:** Nietzsche considered Kant's "reason" a myth. In his opinion, what Kant called "pure reason" is itself a product of the **instincts, needs, and history** of a specific species (humans). Reason is a tool of the will to power for life, not a neutral, transcendent judge.
3.  **Critique of Universalism:** Nietzsche is a philosopher of **perspectivism**. There is no absolute truth (or absolute morality). Kant's ethics is, in fact, the particular perspective of one human group (European Christians) imposed on everyone in the name of "reason." This is the **tyranny of reason**.
4.  **Admission of Greatness:** Despite all criticisms, Nietzsche admired Kant's intellectual greatness. He called him the "philosopher of philosophers" who correctly posed the problem of knowledge, even if his answers were wrong from Nietzsche's perspective.

**Summary of Nietzsche's View:** Kant is a **secularized Christian theologian** who, with the weapon of logic, preserved the last bastions of Christian metaphysics and ethics in the modern world.

**B) Freud's Critique: Discovering the Hidden Forces Behind Reason**
Freud did not write directly about Kant, but his entire psychoanalytic project is an implicit critique of the "rational essence" of man in Kant's philosophy.
1.  **Critique of the Rational "Self":** Kant speaks of a **conscious, unified, and rational subject** who is the ethical decision-maker. Freud shattered this image. He showed that the human mind is a battlefield of **unconscious forces** (sexual and aggressive drives, childhood memories, complexes). The conscious "self" (ego) is just the tip of the iceberg.
2.  **Rooting the Categorical Imperative:** From Freud's view, **Kant's Categorical Imperative is the "Superego."** The Superego is the internalization of the commands, prohibitions, and ideals of the father and society in childhood. That "voice of duty" within us is not a pure rational law but the **neurotic reflection of patriarchal authority**.
3.  **Critique of Autonomy:** If our will is deeply influenced by unconscious conflicts, then the **absolute freedom and autonomy** of Kant is an illusion. Man is more of a **puppet** of unconscious forces than a completely free legislator.

**Summary of Freud's View:** What Kant considered "pure practical reason" is actually the **post-hoc, logical rationalization of deeply unconscious and instinctual human desires and conflicts**. Kant's moral philosophy is the formal, transcendent description of psychological mechanisms rooted in childhood and primitive drives.

**Combined View of Both:**
*   **Nietzsche:** Kant is an **ideological philosopher** who eternalized and universalized the values of a specific culture in the name of "reason."
*   **Freud:** Kant is a **naïve philosopher** who ignored the complex, dark, and instinctual level of the human psyche and saw only its thin, conscious, and rational layer.

Both challenged the **anthropological foundation** of Kant's philosophy (man as an essentially rational and free being) and showed that this image is either an ideological construct (Nietzsche) or a psychological illusion (Freud).

### **Final Analysis: Was Kant Successful in Solving the Human Problem?**

**Short Answer: No, Kant did not claim to solve the "human problem" in the sense of eliminating all suffering and existential contradictions.** But he provided a **fundamental and revolutionary framework for *understanding, organizing, and giving meaning* to fundamental human problems** that remains valid and challenging to this day.

Let's examine this answer more carefully:

**1. What was Kant's Goal?**
Kant's goal was a **"revolution in the way of thinking,"** not to provide a practical manual for a happy life or create an earthly paradise. He wanted to answer three basic questions:
1. **What can I know?** (The problem of **science and truth**)
2. **What ought I to do?** (The problem of **ethics and freedom**)
3. **What may I hope for?** (The problem of **meaning and purpose**)

**Thus, the "human problem" from Kant's perspective was the problem of "intellectual and moral disorientation" of modern man.**

**2. In What Areas Was He "Successful"? (Revolutionary Achievements)**
Kant was extraordinarily successful in **redefining and setting the boundaries of these problems**.

✅ **In Solving the Problem of "Science" (Critique of Pure Reason):**
- **Success:** He showed **why and how Newtonian science is possible.** By explaining that the human mind imposes its own laws on nature, he created a solid foundation for empirical science.
- **But:** He also proved that **human reason can never provide definitive theoretical answers to metaphysical questions (God, immortality, the absolute beginning).** He did not "solve" this problem but showed that **these questions are fundamentally unanswerable in the theoretical realm** and pursuing them leads to a dead end. This in itself was a negative but crucial solution: **setting limits to human claims.**

✅ **In Solving the Problem of "Ethics" (Critique of Practical Reason):**
- **Success:** He provided an **independent and self-grounded foundation for ethics** that relied on no religion, tradition, or utilitarian calculus. The **Categorical Imperative** became a universal, rational criterion for distinguishing good from bad.
- **But:** This ethics was **the formulation of the ethical problem, not its practical solution.** Kant did not say, "All humans will now be moral." He said: **"If you want your action to be moral, follow this criterion."** The conflict between inclination and duty remained.

✅ **In Solving the Problem of "Hope" (Linking the First and Second Critiques):**
- **Major Success:** This is where Kant's genius shines. He built a bridge between two worlds:
    - **The World of Nature** (causal determinism, science) ← *First Critique*
    - **The World of Freedom** (free will, morality) ← *Second Critique*
  Kant asked: If we live in a deterministic world, how is **moral freedom possible?** His answer: **Humans live simultaneously in two realms.** As phenomenon, we are subject to the laws of nature, but as noumenon, we are **free and autonomous**. Therefore, morality is not just an ideal but **possible**.
  Furthermore, he presented **God and immortality** not as theoretical truths but as **"necessary postulates of practical reason"**: For the "highest good" (the union of virtue and happiness) to be meaningful, one must be able to hope for an opportunity for moral perfection (immortality) and a just orderer (God).
  **This was Kant's "solution":** He solved the conflict between science and religion, determinism and free will, **by changing the level of analysis**. He moved the problem from the level of "objective reality" to the level of **"the conditions for the possibility of moral experience."**

**3. So Why Do We Say He Didn't Fully "Solve the Human Problem"?**

🔴 **Because objective, tangible human problems remained:**
- Poverty, war, injustice, and human suffering did not disappear with Kant's philosophy.
- He did not provide a practical guide for organizing society or fighting evil.

🔴 **Because internal tensions in his system remained unresolved:**
- **The Phenomenon/Noumenon Dualism:** This gap between what we know and what is became a major "problem" for later philosophers.
- **Formalistic Ethics:** The Categorical Imperative in complex human situations (e.g., "a white lie to save someone's life") can lead to inhuman results.
- **The Abstract Rational Being:** Kant's "rational human" is considered in a vacuum, without sufficient attention to history, culture, emotions, and material conditions of life.

**4. Final Judgment: How Successful Was Kant?**

If "solving a problem" means **completely and practically eliminating an issue**, then **Kant failed**.

But if "solving a problem" means **creating a powerful framework for understanding, formulating, and rationally confronting humanity's deepest questions**, then **Kant was one of the most successful philosophers in history.**

**Kant's Legacy is this:**
1.  **He gave humanity the gift of "intellectual maturity":** The courage to use one's own reason without relying on external authorities.
2.  **He defined the "playing field":** He specified in which areas reason can claim knowledge and in which it must be humble.
3.  **He provided a "measure":** Both for science (compatibility with the *a priori* conditions of experience) and for ethics (universality and respect for human dignity).

**In an Analogy:**
Kant was like a **brilliant engineer** who provided an exact, analytical blueprint of the "building of human existence." He showed which walls are load-bearing (the mind's *a priori* structures), which rooms are habitable (the phenomenal world), and which rooms are only conceived on the blueprint but can never be entered (the noumenal world).
He did not **repair** the building (he did not solve everyday life problems), but he provided **such a precise and revolutionary blueprint** that every subsequent architect or inhabitant (every philosopher or thinking human) must refer to this blueprint first to understand the building of their own existence—even if they later criticize or modify it.

**Final Answer:** Kant did not solve the "human problem" in the sense of removing suffering, but he gave humanity an **unparalleled tool for understanding this problem and living with intellectual and ethical dignity in the midst of it.** His success lies not in providing the "final answer," but in the **correct and enduring formulation of the ultimate questions**.
