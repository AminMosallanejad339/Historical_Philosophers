# David Hume

## Overview

David Hume was a Scottish Enlightenment philosopher, historian, and economist, widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the tradition of empiricism and modern skepticism. By questioning the foundations of traditional metaphysics and emphasizing sensory experience as the only valid source of knowledge, he had a profound and revolutionary impact on Western philosophy, paving the way for the emergence of analytic philosophy and logical positivism.

## Biography

David Hume was born on May 7, 1711 (Old Style) in Edinburgh, Scotland. He was raised in a moderately well-off but not wealthy family. He attended the University of Edinburgh at a young age but never obtained a degree, acquiring most of his knowledge through self-study. After a failed stint in commerce, he went to France where he wrote his major work, *A Treatise of Human Nature*. Upon returning, he worked as a secretary, librarian, and diplomat. His initial fame came more from his historical writings than his philosophical ones. In his later years, he was recognized as a prominent figure in European intellectual circles. He died in Edinburgh on August 25, 1776.

## Philosophical Contributions

Hume adopted a radical approach to examine the foundations of human knowledge:

1.  **Empiricism and the Theory of Perception:** He divided all contents of the mind into two categories: **Impressions** (vivid present sensations) and **Ideas** (the fainter copies of these sensations). He argued that all our ideas ultimately originate from sensory experience.
2.  **Critique of Causation:** Hume argued that we can never directly observe a causal connection; what we perceive is merely "constant conjunction" of events. Our belief in causation is a **habit** of the mind born from repeated experience, not a logical deduction.
3.  **Skepticism Regarding the Self:** Hume rejected the "self" as a stable, unified entity. He described the self as nothing but "a bundle or collection of different perceptions" in perpetual flux.
4.  **The Problem of Induction:** He demonstrated that universal propositions based on experience (induction) cannot be justified by logical reasoning, as arguing that the future will resemble the past itself requires justification.
5.  **Humean Ethics:** Hume located the origin of morality in "sentiment" (feeling), not in reason. Reason is merely a tool; the primary motive for moral action is feelings like sympathy and utility. He also famously articulated the **Is-Ought Problem**: one cannot derive prescriptive statements ("ought") from descriptive statements ("is").
6.  **Critique of Arguments for God's Existence:** He challenged the design and cosmological arguments for God's existence, arguing they offered, at best, a weak probability.

## Major Works

1.  **A Treatise of Human Nature** (1739–1740) – His major systematic philosophical work, initially met with indifference.
2.  **An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding** (1748) – A simpler and more engaging rewrite of the first part of the Treatise.
3.  **An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals** (1751) – Presentation of his sentiment-based moral theory.
4.  **The History of England** (1754–1762) – A six-volume work that made him famous in his lifetime.
5.  **Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion** (1779, posthumous) – A sharp critique of natural theology.

## Influence and Legacy

Hume is one of the most influential philosophers in history. **Immanuel Kant** credited "Hume's skepticism" with waking him from his "dogmatic slumber," leading to his own Critical philosophy. In the 20th century, **logical positivists** like A.J. Ayer drew inspiration from Hume. **Classical economics** (especially his close friend Adam Smith) was shaped by his empiricism and social analysis. In the social sciences, his emphasis on observation and habit over necessary laws was pioneering. Contemporary analytic philosophy and debates on causation, induction, and naturalism are deeply indebted to Hume's challenges.

> "Reason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them."
>
> "If we take in our hand any volume of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, *Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number?* No. *Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence?* No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion."
