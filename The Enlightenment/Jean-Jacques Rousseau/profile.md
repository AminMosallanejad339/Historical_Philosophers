# Jean-Jacques Rousseau

## Overview
Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a Genevan philosopher, writer, and composer whose political philosophy and ideas about education, human nature, and society profoundly influenced the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the development of modern political, educational, and sociological thought. He is best known for his concepts of the "social contract" and the "noble savage," and for his critique of modern civilization as corrupting humanity's natural goodness.

## Biography
Jean-Jacques Rousseau was born on June 28, 1712, in Geneva, a then-independent republic. His mother died shortly after his birth. Apprenticed to an engraver as a teenager, he fled Geneva at 16. He spent much of his early adulthood wandering, working as a secretary, tutor, and musician. Largely self-educated, he moved to Paris in 1742. His entry into intellectual fame came in 1750 with his winning *Discourse on the Arts and Sciences*. His subsequent major works made him famous but also controversial, leading to condemnation and exile from France and Geneva. He spent his later years in poverty and paranoia, moving between Switzerland, England, and France. He died on July 2, 1778, in Ermenonville, France.

## Philosophical Contributions
Rousseau's work represents a critical and unique strand within the Enlightenment, emphasizing emotion, nature, and the critique of social institutions.

1.  **Human Nature & Civilization:** Rousseau argued that humans are naturally good, free, and equal ("noble savage"). It is society—with its institutions of property, competition, and artificial inequality—that corrupts them and creates vices like envy and domination (concepts of *amour de soi* vs. destructive *amour-propre*).
2.  **The Social Contract:** His most famous political idea. Legitimate political authority must be based on a collective agreement (contract) where individuals, in seeking to preserve their freedom, unite under the **General Will**—the common interest of the citizen body, which is sovereign. This established the principle of **popular sovereignty**.
3.  **Education:** In *Émile*, he outlined a child-centered, "negative" education. The tutor should shield the child from society's corrupting influence and allow learning to follow the child's natural curiosity and developmental stages, emphasizing experience over books.
4.  **Inequality:** In his *Discourse on Inequality*, he traced the psychological and political consequences of the invention of private property, which led to social hierarchy, dependency, and universal alienation.
5.  **Religion & Morality:** He advocated for a "civil religion" of simple, moral precepts to support social unity and for a personal, emotional faith based on inner conscience and the beauty of nature, as opposed to institutional dogma.

## Major Works
1.  **Discourse on the Arts and Sciences** (1750) – Argues that moral progress has declined as the arts and sciences have advanced.
2.  **Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality Among Men** (1755) – Traces the social and psychological origins of inequality.
3.  **Julie, or the New Heloise** (1761) – An influential novel celebrating nature, emotion, and romantic love.
4.  **The Social Contract** (1762) – His seminal work of political philosophy defining legitimate government.
5.  **Émile, or On Education** (1762) – A revolutionary treatise on education, also containing the "Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar," which led to its condemnation.
6.  **Confessions** (published posthumously, 1782) – A pioneering and intimate autobiography.

## Influence and Legacy
Rousseau's influence is immense and multifaceted. His ideas on popular sovereignty and the general will became the ideological bedrock of the **French Revolution** (especially for the Jacobins) and inspired modern **republican and democratic movements**. His critique of inequality and private property influenced **socialist thinkers** like Marx. His emphasis on emotion, nature, and the individual conscience made him a father of the **Romantic movement**. In education, his ideas paved the way for **progressive, child-centered** approaches (Pestalozzi, Montessori). His works also sparked deep debates about freedom, authority, and the tension between individual rights and the collective good that remain central to political theory today.
