# Adam Smith

## Overview

Adam Smith was a Scottish philosopher and economist, widely regarded as the father of modern economics. His seminal work, *The Wealth of Nations*, laid the intellectual foundation for free-market capitalism, arguing that individuals pursuing their self-interest in a competitive marketplace inadvertently benefit society as a whole through an "invisible hand." His ideas on division of labor, free trade, and the limits of government intervention remain profoundly influential.

## Biography

Adam Smith was born in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, in 1723 (baptized June 16). He attended the University of Glasgow and later Balliol College, Oxford. In 1751, he became a professor at the University of Glasgow, first teaching logic and then moral philosophy. From 1764 to 1766, he traveled Europe as a tutor to the Duke of Buccleuch, meeting key intellectuals like Voltaire and Quesnay. He spent the next decade writing *The Wealth of Nations* in Kirkcaldy and London. In 1778, he was appointed Commissioner of Customs in Edinburgh, where he lived until his death on July 17, 1790.

## Philosophical Contributions

Smith's contributions span moral philosophy and political economy. In *The Theory of Moral Sentiments*, he proposed that morality stems from social sympathy and an "impartial spectator" within us. His economic theory, detailed in *The Wealth of Nations*, revolutionized the field. Key contributions include:
- **The Invisible Hand:** The concept that individuals' pursuit of self-interest in a free market leads to socially beneficial outcomes, as if guided by an unseen force.
- **Division of Labor:** His famous pin factory example illustrated how specialization dramatically increases productivity, driving economic growth.
- **The Source of Wealth:** He argued that a nation's wealth derives from the productive labor of its people, not its stock of gold (rejecting mercantilism).
- **Free Trade and Markets:** He advocated for minimal government interference, free international trade based on "absolute advantage," and competitive markets to keep prices low and quality high.
- **The Role of Government:** He assigned government three main duties: national defense, administration of justice, and providing public works/institutions the market cannot profitably supply.

## Major Works

1. **The Theory of Moral Sentiments** (1759) - Explores the foundations of ethics, emphasizing sympathy and social bonds.
2. **An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations** (1776) - The foundational text of classical economics, analyzing markets, labor, and economic policy.
3. **Essays on Philosophical Subjects** (1795, posthumous) - A collection of his writings on science, the arts, and history.

## Influence and Legacy

Adam Smith's legacy is monumental. *The Wealth of Nations* provided the theoretical backbone for the rise of industrial capitalism and was highly influential on policymakers like William Pitt the Younger. In the 19th century, classical economists like David Ricardo and Thomas Malthus expanded his ideas. His advocacy for free trade remains a cornerstone of global economics. While often simplified as an apostle of pure self-interest, the modern understanding of Smith emphasizes the balance in his thought between the market (*Wealth of Nations*) and moral-social bonds (*Theory of Moral Sentiments*). He is a central figure in debates on economic policy, globalization, and the ethical foundations of market societies.
