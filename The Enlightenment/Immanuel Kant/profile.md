### **Immanuel Kant: Overview**
**Brief Introduction and Historical Significance**
Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) was a German philosopher of the Enlightenment who is widely regarded as one of the most influential thinkers in modern Western philosophy. His "Copernican Revolution" in philosophy proposed that objective reality is shaped by the mind's structures, rather than the mind conforming to reality. This critical philosophy sought to define the limits and scope of human reason, reconciling empiricism with rationalism and setting the foundation for much of subsequent European thought.

### **Key Information**
*   **Era:** The Enlightenment (specifically, the late 18th century, often called the "Age of Critique").
*   **Key Concepts:** The "Copernican Revolution" in philosophy, Transcendental Idealism, Categorical Imperative, "Sapere Aude" (Dare to know), Public vs. Private Reason, Perpetual Peace.
*   **Major Works:** *Critique of Pure Reason* (1781/1787), *Critique of Practical Reason* (1788), *Critique of the Power of Judgment* (1790), *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals* (1785), *Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics* (1783).
*   **Influences:** Christian Wolff (Leibnizian rationalism), David Hume (who "awoke him from his dogmatic slumber"), Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Isaac Newton, Montesquieu.
*   **Legacy:** Foundation of German Idealism (Fichte, Hegel, Schelling), profound impact on ethics, epistemology, aesthetics, political theory, and philosophy of religion. His ideas continue to be central to all philosophical discourse.

### **Biography**
*   **Place and Date of Birth:** April 22, 1724, in Königsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia).
*   **Education:** Studied at the University of Königsberg, focusing initially on physics, mathematics, and the Leibniz-Wolffian philosophy.
*   **Career:** After working as a private tutor, he returned to the University of Königsberg in 1755 as a *Privatdozent* (unsalaried lecturer). In 1770, he was appointed Professor of Logic and Metaphysics. His life was famously orderly, disciplined, and dedicated entirely to scholarly pursuit. He never traveled beyond the vicinity of Königsberg.

### **Philosophical Contributions**
Kant's philosophy, termed "**Critical Philosophy**" or "**Transcendental Idealism**," is organized around three fundamental questions:
1.  **What can I know?** (Epistemology)
2.  **What ought I to do?** (Ethics)
3.  **What may I hope for?** (Religion/Aesthetics)

**1. Epistemology: The Critique of Pure Reason**
*   **The Copernican Revolution:** Kant argued that we do not passively perceive a pre-existing world. Instead, our mind actively structures and constitutes experience through innate *a priori* forms of intuition (space and time) and categories of the understanding (like causality and substance).
*   **Phenomena vs. Noumena:** We can only have knowledge of the world as it appears to us (**phenomena**). The world as it is in itself (**noumena** or the "thing-in-itself") is ultimately inaccessible to theoretical reason.
*   **Limits of Reason:** This framework explains how scientific knowledge is possible (it's about the phenomenal world) and why traditional metaphysics (attempting to know God, the immortal soul, or the cosmos as a whole through reason alone) fails—these are ideas of **pure reason** that we can think but not know.

**2. Ethics: The Categorical Imperative**
*   **Deontological Ethics:** Kant's ethics is based on duty, not consequences. An action is morally good if done from a sense of duty according to a rational principle.
*   **The Categorical Imperative:** The supreme principle of morality. Its most famous formulations are:
    *   **Formula of Universal Law:** "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."
    *   **Formula of Humanity:** "Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end."
*   **Autonomy:** True moral action springs from the rational self-legislation of the will (autonomy), in contrast to being driven by desires or external authority (heteronomy).

**3. Aesthetics and Teleology: The Critique of Judgment**
*   **Judgment of Beauty:** He analyzed the judgment of taste as being **disinterested**, **universal**, and based on the "free play" of our understanding and imagination.
*   **The Sublime:** Distinguished from the beautiful, the sublime evokes awe and arises from encounters with overwhelming power or magnitude that ultimately confirms our rational vocation.
*   **Teleology:** Proposed that we must sometimes judge living organisms and nature *as if* they have purposes, even if we cannot prove it scientifically.

### **Major Works**
*   **Critique of Pure Reason (1781/1787):** His monumental work on epistemology and metaphysics.
*   **Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics (1783):** A shorter, more accessible summary of the first *Critique*.
*   **Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785):** The foundational text for his moral philosophy.
*   **Critique of Practical Reason (1788):** Expands on his ethical theory and discusses the postulates of God, freedom, and immortality.
*   **Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790):** Unifies his system through analyses of aesthetics and teleology.
*   **Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch (1795):** A seminal work in political philosophy outlining conditions for international peace.

### **Influence and Legacy**
*   **German Idealism:** Directly inspired Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, who sought to overcome the noumenal/phenomenal distinction.
*   **Modern Philosophy:** Set the agenda for virtually all subsequent philosophy. Responses to Kant define movements like phenomenology (Husserl), existentialism, and analytic philosophy.
*   **Ethics:** Remains the central reference point for all deontological moral theories. John Rawls' theory of justice is deeply Kantian.
*   **Political Theory:** His ideas on autonomy, republicanism, and perpetual peace are cornerstones of modern liberal and cosmopolitan thought.
*   **Contemporary Relevance:** His questions about the limits of knowledge, the nature of moral obligation, and the conditions for human freedom are perennially relevant in debates about AI, human rights, and scientific authority.
